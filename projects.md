## DRSuite — Diffusion–Relaxation MRI Software
Open-source toolkit for multidimensional MRI: phantom generation, spectral estimation (NNLS/ADMM/LADMM), visualization, and CRLB-based acquisition analysis.  
- Link: https://drsuite.org

## Multimodal Survival Analysis (QRT Challenge ’26)
End-to-end survival pipeline for adult myeloid leukemia prognosis using multi-center clinical + somatic mutation data.  
- Cox / XGBoost-Cox, 5-fold CV, tuned against IPCW C-index at τ = 7 years.

## Linearized ADMM for Spatial–Spectral Mapping
Developed and benchmarked a linearized ADMM solver with structural regularization and finite-difference priors, achieving major speedups and memory savings in spatial–spectral recovery.

## Axon Radii Estimation from Clinical dMRI
Predictive estimator for high-b diffusion signals from low-b clinical acquisitions using sparse spherical ridgelets + bi-exponential decay, solved via ADMM; validated on synthetic and in-vivo data.
